# Fake SMTP

## Why ?

I was growing tired of the application i'm currently working on sending exceptions because of no SMTP server available for local development/debug.

So i created a simple wrapper around SubEthaSMTP, embedded in a war file.

It has since grow in a webapp for displaying received mails.
